<p>The premise begins with the recognition of the ancients’ ingenuity in defining human vices in religious texts with clear bounds. Certain limits appear to have existed in the sources of intent and people’s behavior, which have often led to the analysis of individual actions since, in literature as much as in the court of law. The seven deadly sins only give us a morally negative side of human behavior, and since there isn’t such a popular set of positive traits, in exploration we will constrain ourselves with sins due to their incentivizing factor. This limitation may not be a poor condition if we recognize that the list of vices, in addition to being a guide to what ought to be frowned upon and not indulged, is also a decent indicator of motivation of players in games. As we will see, in certain conditions the absence of sin in a player can sometimes be a negative harming the system. We will take into account players’ levels of influence and sin (motivation), which reveal imbalances usually taken for granted in analysis but rarely quantified. The subjective nature of the archaic sin list will not allow us to build a model with variables we can fully trust, nor will it allow for falsifiability. As such, we are only to experiment with values without putting the highest confidence in them. By enumerating players by influence we assign leverage, and by adding motivation levels using sin values we try to infer who may be inclined to use it.</p>

<h2 id="concept">Concept</h2>

<p>The basic principle that will be used to map out pressure points of motivation in econopolitical scenarios involves naming the players and lining up the seven possible sins to each. Then, assigning by guesswork numerical values to every sin and summing each player’s sins into totals. For sin magnitudes we will take the scale between 0 and 1.</p>

<p>In this table we express:</p>

<p>(i) $s_{i,j}$ = sin value for player $i$, sin $j$,</p>

<p>(ii) $\Sigma_j = \sum_{i=1}^{n} s_{i,j}$ (row sum of sin total across all players)</p>

<p>(iii) $\Sigma_i = \sum_{j=1}^{7} s_{i,j}$ (column sum of player $i$’s sin values)</p>

<p>A scale from -1 to 1 can be used if more dimensions are desired, giving negative sins—virtues as inverses of sins, where we can imagine Diligence as the opposite of Sloth, Patience as the opposite of Wrath, and so on. It should be noted, however, that introducing more dimensions to a subjective model will make it even less reasonable and consistent. Nevertheless, considering that we are only working with the totals of sin values due to our strict interpretation, the individual sin value matters much less than the cumulative sin.</p>

<p>Social structures, events, and happenings may be layered (macro, micro, meso), whereby the model allows for analysis of each layer individually, possibly later taking into account the motivations emerging from lower to higher layers. Another aspect to recognize on a per-scenario basis is the nature of the happening, where the state selected for analysis may be based on linear and non-linear expectations.</p>

<p>We can say that the Sindex model is most reasonable when the players can directly influence each other, compete for the same or similar resources, and their motivations manifest in comparable ways.</p>

<p>For visualization, it is worth ordering players by influence to standardize commonly appearing patterns. In deciding this, only the initial and not the potential influences should be taken into account. The levels of influence of some players may be so similar that it cannot be said with certainty which one has more. This will have to be tolerated, unless the motivations of one or more players become so significant that all of the values must be reset—if we want to keep them all in the same bounded system.</p>

<h2 id="interpretation-and-analysis">Interpretation and Analysis</h2>

<p>Applying this method to historical examples, we try for recurring patterns that may emerge in different scenarios. For the sake of demonstration, a surface-level understanding of the presented events must suffice, and it is hoped that there will not be serious misrepresentation. As with any social dynamic, nuances may be present, and extensive analysis of each event would be wasteful when only a showcase of the method is the aim.</p>

<p>Protesters were an explosive, contagious force that could be said to have had maximum Pride based on their basic dignity demands, Lust for freedom, and Wrath against the injustices seen and experienced. While their Sloth was minimal, other sins like Greed for resources and Envy of other nations’ freedoms must too have been prevalent, and so with Gluttony, for change.</p>

<p>The regime could be characterized as a rather stereotypical kleptocracy, clinging to power with high Pride in its authority and Wrath against challengers. Its Greed was maximal, as it controlled national wealth. Gluttony and Lust (for resources, power) were high, and Sloth was relatively low.</p>

<p>The military’s motivations were pragmatic. High Greed and Envy protecting the economic empire. Its Wrath was a tool, its Pride institutional. Its mid-range Sloth reflects a preference for stable hierarchy over chaotic change.
The general public could be marked by higher Sloth that stemmed from clinging to whatever normalcy could be had. Their Gluttony and Lust at large may have been for safety and stability, not revolution; moderate Envy and Greed were for a better life, but not yet actionably so.</p>

<p>The international community was distant, self-interested. Its Greed was for regional stability, its Sloth a reluctance for costly intervention. Its mid-level Pride and Wrath were mostly rhetorical, and whatever Lust or Envy they had was likely more for the novelty of the events.</p>

<p>On social platforms, the majority of users and content creators could be speculated to be moderately to highly slothful, as we can generalize from looking at both the high usage (low Sloth) and the way they publish and interact (high Sloth).</p>

<p>Pride, Greed, Gluttony, Envy and Lust may well be near-maximal for every player. The platforms are highly competitive with one another, engineering for time spent by users and similar metrics. Content creators depend on rather fragile income and attention streams, and users engage in both the consumption of others’ produce and showmanship of their own. It could be said these sins can manifest in public spaces as much as in private interactions.</p>

<p>Sins like Wrath in this and similar cases are more obscure, and it is difficult to say how much anger the players have overall. For necessity, we can say users and content creators have relatively high Wrath, while platforms have it low to moderate.</p>

<p>This is an example of a self-perpetuating system based on a stable high motivation equilibrium. We can speculate that rising sin values of one player tend to increase the sin values of other players, upstream influence especially.</p>

<p>It could be said that Pride played a large part in the actions of every participant where regulators had unchallenged trust in their models, the banks lended and traded MBS as if they had eliminated risk, and the borrowers may have felt they were legally exploiting gaps in the system.</p>

<p>The high Greed, Envy, and Lust of the players should be self-explanatory, except for the regulators’, as it would be difficult to quantify how much was to be gained by them. As for Gluttony, if we treat information and opportunities as its objects, regulators might have had very little of it with regard to their risk data consumption.</p>

<p>Prior to the collapse, there were hardly any things for the players to be angry about, so we assign low Wrath across the board. On the other hand, Sloth was arguably an important driver of each player’s negligence and attraction to low-hanging fruits.</p>

<p>The 2008 financial crisis is where we first see the phenomenon of a “referee,” a player with the highest theoretical influence who, having either low overall sin levels while the less-powerful have them high or high Sloth while the others have Sloth low, is an enabler of highly motivated players to pursue their aims in systems with limited rules and consequences. This often leads to prolonged reckless behaviour.</p>

<p>We see again an asymmetrically motivated system where the most influential player, a slothful referee, had the least incentive to act. If it had more, some of the atrocities may have been prevented.</p>

<p>Both the Bosniak and the Bosnian Serb leaders were highly motivated, as per the latter’s “Greater Serbia” ambitions and the former’s wants to survive and preserve sovereignty, territory. This we note with high values of all sins except for Sloth.</p>

<p>The international community had the inverse—little stake in general with the exception of high Sloth and some incentives slightly higher so we can signify its wishes for the status quo. Only once it intervened was progress made on stopping the events.</p>

<p>Pride of the elite stemmed from Rome’s past glory and empty rituals, and in the Roman Army it emerged from unit identity. Pride of the general populace was being eroded by heavy taxation and corruption. While the general populace was trying to get by, the elite was squeezing the provinces and tax-farming, and the military can be said to have been largely driven by donatives, therefore we can assign high Greed values for all the players.</p>

<p>Lust can be said to go higher with influence, where the populace’s priorities in this sense were linked to basic security, the military’s to stable pay, and the elite’s to decadence and power. Envy was largely rampant, with rivalries between generals and senators for positions in the elite, between frontier and palace legions in the military, and the populace having an idea about the lives of the more powerful. The populace also had little capacity for Gluttony, whereas the military and the elite engaged in ever higher consumption of the empire’s wealth.</p>

<p>All of the players can be said to have had high Wrath, as each was dealing with its own troubles. The Senate saw an increasing number of domestic conflicts across regions, and so did the military in its own way, with mutinies. The Sloth of each player was likely also high, as the populace could not do much about its exploitation and was demoralized as a result, the military was relying on old tactics and outsourced the fighting to mercenaries, and the elite was using old formulas for governance incompatible with the state of affairs at hand.</p>

<p>This suggests that high Sloth, when found in many players at once, may signal a system’s growing vulnerability to opportunistic external entities, living or not. The total sin levels that grow with the levels of influence can also signal decay, that is, when the consumers are motivated but the producers are not.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/east_asian_miracle.png" alt="Player motivation totals for the East Asian Miracle" /></p>

<p>East Asia was largely a devastated region as it entered the second half of the 20th century; its economies had a scratch to start from. The participants, being almost certainly aware that immediate and easy returns were hardly possible, must have been acting based upon longer-term plans, as displayed by the delayed gratification priorities from frugality and high savings rates.</p>

<p>We might assign low Sloth and low Gluttony, high everything else to their institutions and workforce, as the two players were closely aligned. There was likely Pride in national development and Greed and Lust for wealth and infrastructure respectively, Envy and Wrath in relation to foreign states’ comforts and past domestic hardships.</p>

<p>The international community was eager to purchase and consume the cheap goods produced and only later started outsourcing its work; there was little interest outside of this. We can thus assign high Gluttony, Greed, Sloth, and moderate Lust to the international community, leaving low sin values for Pride, Envy, and Wrath.</p>

<p>This may be the inverse of the Fall of Rome. In East Asia, motivations of the ruling class and the middle class aligned instead of being based upon a hierarchy layer’s influence.</p>

<h3 id="clarification-on-sloth-and-low-sin">Clarification on Sloth and Low Sin</h3>

<p>A small disconnect appears when we note that all sins except Sloth relate to activity and movement. However, having forced Sloth in alongside the other sins for a sense of completion, this does not stop us from recognizing that Sloth alone may indicate some of the more nuanced features of a scenario. As per the financial bubble and the Balkans examples, high Sloth in the most powerful player can allow the less powerful to act without consequences if their Sloth happens to be low. If a pair of the less powerful players are in active competition with one another in this scenario, the warring may continue until one of the players effectively disappears from the game. With this, a social system tends to spiral out of control and ends up in a disaster.</p>

<p>On the other hand, high Sloth and moderate everything else might indicate that a player does not intend to act regardless of his desires.</p>

<p>Similar phenomena may be implied when we assign low sin values across the board to a player, although another distinction is possible. Depending on the player, the same low values on all sins could suggest different tendencies, so by separating low sin into active and passive we can differentiate between discipline and negligence. The monk, principled activist, or ethical judge to whom one assigns low sin values can be highly motivated without exhibiting most of the archaic sins, while much more common is a low-sin player who does not see a reason to act. It could be suggested that a sin like Lust should be used, for ethics or principles, but that still leaves only one significant motivation out of seven. One solution to simplifying this is to introduce negative sin values, which would give a two-sided scale of motivation totals that clarifies whether the motivation comes from the common vices or from their absence.</p>

<h2 id="scale-balances">Scale Balances</h2>

<h3 id="self-perpetuating-equilibrium">Self-Perpetuating Equilibrium</h3>

<p>Games in which players are equally highly motivated could be said to have the characteristics of almost perpetual continuity. Since the incentives cannot be satisfied at once and thus sin values do not decrease or become dissimilar among the players, resource availability makes it possible for them to remain with unchanging motivation levels and persist with certain behaviours. This can be vividly observed in cases of social media and markets. Changes to the structure and tools of the game can be made, but that does not mean motivation totals would become asymmetric as the players in such cases are usually very dependent on one another.</p>

<h3 id="unstable-systems">Unstable Systems</h3>

<p>Players having significant differences in motivation levels can be a source of brittleness in a system. This would stop a system from continuing as-is for too long. A high-influence slothful referee is not creating or enforcing rules, while a demoralized workforce is not producing what its ruling class desires (the opposite could apply to precursors of revolutions).</p>

<h2 id="some-implications">Some Implications</h2>

<h3 id="the-need-for-layers">The Need for Layers</h3>

<p>Any such table or payoff matrix that we create should always be confined to a layer. In a sociological sense, a layer can translate to a timeframe, size, intensity, and similar bounds linked to players. This could prevent us from analyzing unrelated or only seemingly relevant players and events. However, we can speculate that solving a social puzzle of a small game may give answers to a model setup of a related larger game, and vice versa. Our examples from the previous sections only referred to the highest layers, ignoring nuance for demonstration purposes.</p>

<h3 id="sin-dynamics">Sin Dynamics</h3>

<p>There is the necessity of treating games as separate states and thus making new sin tables each time. Aside from the need for states, one reason for this is that even in games with high and similar motivation levels, or equilibriums, a player may still become significantly more motivated than the rest, which the model’s bounds will not allow unless the table is reset and normalized. 
We could also say that the rate of change in a player’s sin values can influence future sin values. Rapidly dropping overall sin scores may be saying that the game as we know it has concluded, while rapidly rising scores may say that the game is just picking up intensity. Fast-spawned high motivation equilibriums could result in establishing competition stability or a quick loss of any certainty. Individually, for example, a rapidly rising Wrath score is a possible precursor to “explosions,” while a rapidly rising Sloth might show a certain path to collapse.</p>

<h2 id="in-symbols">In Symbols</h2>

<p>We define a state of the game at step $k$ as a tuple</p>

\[T_k = (P_k, S_k)\]

<p>where $P_k = {p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n}$ is the set of players.</p>

<p>$S_k$ is the sin matrix, an $n \times 7$ real matrix where the entry $s_{i,j}(k) \in [0,1]$ (or $[-1,1]$) quantifies the magnitude of sin $j$ for player $p_i$ at step $k$. The columns correspond to the canonical seven sins (Pr, Gr, Lu, En, Gl, Wr, Sl).</p>

<p>Each of the 7 sins can have a number of possible actions associated with them. An action $\alpha$ is an event initiated by a player $p_i \in P_k$, associated with a primary motivating sin $j$. Its completion status is given by a variable $c(\alpha) \in [0,1]$. That is, to indicate that an action is complete, the node value for action could be said to be 0 or 1, or if more intricacy is desired, 0 and non-zero value up to 1 with a level of completion using fractions.</p>

<p>The execution of an action $\alpha$ by player $p_i$ in state $T_k$ can produce a new state $T_{k+1}$ via a transition function $\Phi$ with</p>

\[T_{k+1} = \Phi(T_k, p_i, \alpha)\]

<p>which updates the system by:</p>

<p>(i) Modifying the sin vector of the acting player: $\mathbf{s}_i(k+1) \neq \mathbf{s}_i(k)$.</p>

<p>(ii) Possibly modifying the sin vectors of other players: $\mathbf{s}_\ell(k+1) \neq \mathbf{s}_\ell(k) \text{ for } \ell \neq i$</p>

<p>(iii) Possibly altering the player set: $P_{k+1} \neq P_k$, where players may get added or removed from the game if some action is complete.</p>

<p>For each player $p_i$ at state $T_k$, we define a:</p>

<p>(i) Motivation total: $\Sigma_i(k) = \sum_{j=1}^{7} s_{i,j}(k)$</p>

<p>(ii) Influence: $I(p_i) \in \mathbb{R}^+$, ordered such that $I(p_1) \geq I(p_2) \geq \cdots \geq I(p_n)$</p>

<p>Patterns can emerge from the relationship between $\Sigma_i(k)$ and $I(p_i)$:</p>

<p>(i) Equilibrium: $
|\Sigma_i(k) - \Sigma_\ell(k)| &lt; \varepsilon
$ for all players (high symmetry in motivation)</p>

<p>(ii) Instability: $\max_i(\Sigma_i) - \min_\ell(\Sigma_\ell) &gt; \theta$ for some threshold $\theta$</p>

<p>(iii) Slothful Referee: $I(p_1) \gg I(p_2)$ and $\Sigma_1(k) \ll \Sigma_2(k)$</p>

<p>Regarding the rate of change, the difference in sin values between consecutive states indicates system variations:</p>

\[\Delta s_{i,j} = s_{i,j}(k+1) - s_{i,j}(k)\]

<p>Large $
|\Delta s_{i,j}|$ values indicate inflection points. For instance, rapidly rising $\Sigma_i(k)
$ can suggest escalating engagement, rapidly falling $\Sigma_i(k)$ can suggest game conclusion or player exhaustion. Sharp increase in $s_{i,\text{Wr}}$ may precede aggressive action.</p>

<p>Action $\alpha$ by player $p_i$ may alter sin values of player $p_j$. For example,</p>

<p>(i) $s_{j,\text{En}}(k+1)$ may increase if $\alpha$ benefits $p_i$</p>

<p>(ii) $s_{j,\text{Wr}}(k+1)$ may increase if $\alpha$ harms $p_j$</p>

<p>(iii) $s_{i,\text{Sl}}(k+1)$ may decrease if $\alpha$ requires significant effort</p>

<h3 id="payoff-attribution">Payoff Attribution</h3>

<p>The sin value tables from the previous sections assume we do not know precisely what resources are available to the players to be gained or lost. If we do know what is at stake, the subjectivity of the Sindex can be replaced or accompanied by a more game theory-adjacent model like the following.</p>

<p>For a given game state $T_k$, let $E = {e_1, e_2, \ldots, e_m}$ be the set of possible outcomes. The associated payoff matrix $\Pi_k$ is an $n \times m$ real matrix where the entry $\pi_{i,q}(k)$ quantifies the gain or loss to player $p_i$ upon the realization of outcome $e_q$. Payoffs can be denominated in a common unit like fiat currency.</p>

<p>* Boat valued at $20K</p>

<p>** 100 Ha land at $2K/Ha = $200K</p>

<p>This can be made with the rule of progression with events ordered sequentially ($e_1 \to e_2 \to \cdots \to e_m$) where an event cannot happen unless a denoted preceding event occurs. Having an event with the same payoff that two or more players compete for may introduce urgency and thus prioritize it, as one player’s direction forces the other interested players to pursue that event simultaneously.</p>

<p>The sums of events’ and players’ payoffs can be treated as expected values in a game, offering a similar line of thinking to that of the sin model based on motivation totals.</p>

<p>The aggregate incentive for a player $p_i$ in state $T_k$ is given by an expected value function. In its simplest form, as a sum over potential outcomes:</p>

\[\text{EV}_i(k) = \sum_{q=1}^{m} \pi_{i,q}(k)\]

<p>A more nuanced form weights payoffs by the probability $\rho_{i,q}(k)$ that player $p_i$ will pursue or achieve outcome $e_q$, which can be estimated from their sin vector $\mathbf{s}_i(k)$:</p>

\[\text{EV}_i(k) = \sum_{q=1}^{m} \rho_{i,q}(k) \cdot \pi_{i,q}(k)\]

<p>When $\rho_{i,q}(k)$ is uniform (equal probability across outcomes), $\text{EV}_i(k)$ reduces to the simple sum shown in earlier examples.</p>

<p>We can also introduce influence scoring for this type of modelling. Mapping totals on a plane would show how the incentives change as influence grows.</p>

<p>Forced alongside the sin model, this would only address Greed if we say that Gluttony is only about consumption and Lust is about general infatuation. While it is possible to try mapping the payoffs more extensively by placing monetary values on traditionally nonmaterial things and so adding other sins, that would almost certainly not be reliable.</p>

<p>Not unlike the subjective sin score model, this largely ignores the rules of games and addresses only the overall player motivations we can name. It is the aim of such accounting to be able to evaluate some characteristics of a game when our knowledge of its rules is limited. Meanwhile, sin value tables assume limited knowledge about available resources. What is denoted as <em>strategies</em> in game theory aligns more to <em>events</em> in the above example’s case which assumes that the probability of some events occurring cannot be affected by the players.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>A certain demand exists for the permanence, traceability, and publicity of data records; one that spans across a great number of domains, including those of the enterprise, the government, all the way to the individual. As it has been demonstrated by putting raw data on a blockchain, as well as the use of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), the applications of blockchains do not end at simple token transfers and can extend to unique, “anchored” records. This has led entrepreneurs and enthusiasts alike to explore the viability of ideas such as decentralized social networks, marketplaces and games, and their users to refer to this on-chain data as historical truth. Permanence here corresponds more to immutability (impossible to alter) than it does to time, as blockchains too can perish. Such benefits, however, do not exist if a user cannot retrieve the actual data that has been recorded, or is only said to have been recorded, on the blockchain. Placing only hashes of records on-chain to reference the material at hand presents this very problem, whereas a receiptlike format that visibly states detail would not. Having standardized on-chain records readable both to the human and to the machine can offer not just immutability, but also the means of processing and organization. The structure of records can easily be made to fit everything from a train’s schedule, a purchase receipt, to a poem or personal manifesto. If necessary, binary files may be included alongside their detail. The aim should be to be able to anchor data on as many blockchains as is feasible, precisely because they are perishable. Given that loading data onto a blockchain can be a practical stress test, this might empirically offer an idea which chains excel at which metrics. Many blockchains fundamentally cannot handle raw data, as they either have built in-limits or unmanageable transaction fees. Fees, however small, can still act as a filter against at-scale dishonesty. However, this should not be a focus—the required trust in a record issuer can be obtained with historical on-chain precedence, public key announcement from the official source, or observations made by other network users.</p>

<h2 id="record-format">Record Format</h2>

<p>We define the format suited for structuring most types of records as JSON-LD, as the support and use of it has been well-established on the internet by now. <a href="https://schema.org/">Schema.org</a> and its contributors provide a number of examples for schemas that we can use to structure a variety of records. Taking the instance of a generic purchase transaction acknowledgement:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>{
  "@context": "https://schema.org/",
  "@type": "SellAction",
  "description": "October 15th 2025 fix of a leak",
  "seller": {

    "name": "Jack Plumber",
    "identifier": "ABC123"
  },

  "location": {
    "@type": "Doe House",
    "address": "31 Spooner St, RI"
  }
}
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Being a highly flexible format, JSON can be extended to fit any type of record, with the level of depth and detail only limited by the preferences of the user or interface designer. Prior to anchoring, JSON should be canonicalized by sorting keys alphabetically to preserve order across different systems. The files should follow the UTF-8 encoding and have no whitespace. Some common record types (@type) can include but mustn’t be constrained only to:</p>

<p><em>Transactions</em>: BuyAction, SellAction, Invoice <br />
<em>Credentials</em>: EducationalOccupationalCredential <br />
<em>Statements</em>: Article, Message, CreativeWork <br />
<em>Creative works</em>: CreativeWork, MediaObject <br />
<em>Legal</em>: use appropriate Schema.org types or extend</p>

<h2 id="protocol-identifier">Protocol Identifier</h2>

<p>Our LARP transactions will include a 5-byte protocol identifier prefix 0x4c41525031 (LARP1 in hexadecimal), which is to appear at the start of the transaction data field:</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0x4c41525031 + [JSON data as hex]</code></p>

<p>The purpose of this identifier is to distinguish LARP messages from other on-chain data, enable potential indexers to find protocol messages, and support numbered protocol versioning.</p>

<p>The full transaction data field would amount to:</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0x[HEX_PROTOCOL_ID][HEX_JSON_DATA]</code></p>

<p>Or:</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0x4c415250317b2240636f6e74657874223a…</code></p>

<p>Which, decoded to UTF-8, will be</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LARP1{"@context":…</code></p>

<h2 id="anchoring-process">Anchoring Process</h2>

<p>For interoperability reasons, JSON is to be canonicalized by sorting its keys alphabetically. The full JSON is then converted to hexadicimal and placed in the transaction data field—this will provide for fast decoding. Then, a transaction is broadcast to the chosen blockchain, from a wallet to itself or any address. A proof file can be generated, which would contain the name of the blockchain, the txid, and the block number. We don’t see it as a necessity to have the original anchored record inside the proof file, as the data is already on-chain. If successful, transactions can be fetched by anyone, using a block explorer or similar tools, and their data—decoded.</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>{
  "proof": {
    "chain": "polygon",
    "chainId": 137,
    "txid": "0xabc...",
    "block": 12345678,
    "timestamp": "2025-10-17T10:30:00Z"
  }
}
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>To experiment and explore practicality, we have created a software utility consisting of three parts for each of the initial blockchains. The first is a wrapper for creating transactions that uses common remote procedure call (RPC) endpoints to communicate with the chain and anchor data. This can be used as a programming library. Another is a way to interact with the wrapper using a command line, and the third—a verifier of proofs.</p>

<p>Record anchoring using the command line can be initiated with the following:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>larp anchor receipt.json --chain polygon --key 0xYOUR_PRIVATE_KEY
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>If desired, the transaction’s proof file can be verified:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>larp verify receipt-proof.json
...
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Programmers can use the anchor as a library, where:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>import { anchorToEVM } from 'permanent-record-protocol';
const proof = await anchorToEVM(
  // JSON data
);

<h2 id="binary-files">Binary Files</h2>

<p>Although the capacities of most blockchains at this time allow only for small chunks, kilobytes of data to be loaded onto them, and the protocol is designed primarily with “receipts” in mind, there exist cases where binary files may be viable and could either supplement such receipts or remain standalone, provided they are loaded in a workable format. In order to maximize compatibility and ease of transformation, binary files should be encoded into Base64 and then wrapped inside the JSON schema. It should be noted, however, that Base64 encoding will increase file sizes by about 33%, applying even more pressure to the blockchains and getting transaction sizes closer to their limits (if applicable), as well as making for higher transaction fees. To create a JSON record that includes an image encoded in Base64:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>cat &gt; contract-record.json &lt;&lt; EOF
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "DigitalDocument",
  "name": "Signed Contract",
  "encodingFormat": "application/pdf",
  "contentData": "$(base64 -w 0 contract.pdf)"
}
EOF
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">encodingFormat</code> key follows MIME types (e.g., “image/jpeg”, “application/pdf”) and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">contentData</code> is the Base64-encoded binary data itself. For retrieval of the anchored file, the transaction is fetched and its (1) hex input data is decoded back to JSON, (2) Base64 from contentData is decoded back to binary, with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">encodingFormat</code> used to determine the filetype. The following schema fields can be used to indicate the nature of the data:</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DigitalDocument</code> for PDF, Word, and other document processing. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ImageObject</code> for photos, scans of documents. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">VideoObject</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AudioObject</code> for video and audio. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MediaObject</code> for general or non-specified binary data.</p>

<h2 id="linking-records">Linking Records</h2>

<p>Having one additional field, records can reference each other by transaction hash. With this, updates or corrections to a record can be made by way of versioning, and related transactions can be linked. Even token transfers can be connected to anchored records. In a sense, certain chains of proof generate, as the order of transactions is not as relevant when references exist. Agreements and acknowledgements between multiple parties then have a way of obtaining structure and searchability if every party involved references records issued by the others. This can also act as a filter against counterfeit records and on-chain noise.</p>

<p>We define a plain URI scheme that in-JSON references can use as their format with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">larp:[chain]:[txid]</code>, where:</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">larp</code> is the protocol identifier <br />
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[chain]</code> is the blockchain name (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">polygon</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ethereum</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bsv</code>, etc.) <br />
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[txid]</code> is the transaction hash</p>

<p>An amendment or correction of a record might look like this:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>{
  "@type": "Article",
  "name": "Updated Essay v2",
  "isBasedOn": "larp:bsv:0xdef456...",
  "textContent": "..."
}
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>An invoice record referencing an order:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Invoice",
  "referencesOrder": "larp:bsv:0xabc123...",
  "totalPaymentDue": {
    "@type": "PriceSpecification",
    "price": 500,
    "priceCurrency": "USD"
  }
}
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>The protocol does not inherently validate references; therefore, a theoretical reference verifier would be needed to check if a referenced transaction exists and contains valid records when decoded, and to map record relationships. Beyond the individual record, for instance, a low trust entity may be one that references others or itself but is not referenced by other entities (tree-like), whereas a high trust entity may be one that both references and is referenced (graph-like). A record of significance may not reference transactions at all but be heavily referenced by other records (reverse tree-like).</p>

<h2 id="identity">Identity</h2>

<p>The public key, or wallet, itself translates to identity, where its owner decides how much to reveal outside and inside the blockchain. While it could be advised not to reuse wallet addresses in token transfers if privacy is of interest, as a record issuer, using the same address for data-only transactions provides for reliable historical precedence. Without additional infrastructure, entities have their track record from anchored records public and queryable by transaction hashes. That is, unless the record happens to be authentic enough for the previous activity of the source to become irrelevant. Block explorers should provide enough information to make decisions based on the activity of entities and the contents of their records.</p>

<h2 id="extensibility">Extensibility</h2>

<p>JSON schemas offered by Schema.org should not be set in stone but extended based on the user’s needs, as attempting to create templates for every possible type of record would be an impossible task. However, additional vocabularies unique to their domain can be created, and themselves extended based on need.</p>

<h2 id="security-and-privacy">Security and Privacy</h2>

<p>The protocol will inherit the security and privacy mechanisms from the blockchain on which it is used. As with most blockchain systems, transactions and their data are immutable, public, and permanent. Changes to a record, to be anchored, require a new transaction with or without the full data, preferably having a reference to the transaction with the preceding version of the record. Data inside the JSON schema can be encrypted by the user if he chooses to utilize the blockchain for its immutability but seeks protection of sensitive data. Where records are not referencing each other, there can be benefits in only the parties involved knowing the addresses used. If available, it is advised to use testnets of the underlying blockchains initially or for experimentation, as mainnet transaction fees can be significant in many cases and costly mistakes should be prevented.</p>

<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>

<p>Some blockchains, for instance, Bitcoin Core, have limits on how much data can be loaded onto them inside a transaction. Others do not have such a limit, but on several, the smallest chunks of data may incur significant fees. For the time being, even some of the most popular blockchains would not be viable for on-chain recordkeeping, as popularity does not always equate to utility. Blockchains which are said to be layers of another tend to have their own handicaps both in operation and philosophy despite the perceived effectiveness. Yet still, there exist options which would not present anchoring data efficiently as a big challenge in spite of a mounting number of transactions. A more detailed comparison between the different blockchains’ limits, costs, and speeds is outlined in the manual stored alongside the source files.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>Introduced is a set of simple procedures for anchoring readable data records on multiple blockchains in a standard format. The anchored schemas may include files, as well as references to other transactions or anchored records. Loading full data directly on a blockchain means the need to consider the costs and the true efficiency of the chosen blockchain network. The incentive for anchoring is the immutability of records, where there can be undeniable evidence that a certain entity had stated something at a certain time, regardless of whether their identity can be surely known. Neither truths nor untruths can be taken back. With structure, records can have more universality and be interpretable by computers. The proposed protocol does not have off-chain dependencies, and the permanence of each record is based solely on the blockchain that holds it. While existing block explorers offer a great deal of transaction tracing tools for the individual record, given an increase in the number and complexity of “record networks,” additional infrastructure may be required that would handle the discovery and indexing of records.</p>

Compared to Communism, alternative systems crumble under pressure and invite unwanted disorder, especially in moneyed environments. It is the only system for which there is undisputed evidence of high profitability and minimal downside. This essay will not only explain in great detail how we know the aforementioned facts for certain, but also introduce ways even you can take advantage of this exciting money-making system today.</p>

<p>Communistic businesses and the free markets they operate in are a rare occurrence, but can be achieved with the help of rigorous systemic thinking and game mechanics. “Cappitalistic” entities currently happen to rule whole societies and are based purely upon the method of turning people against each other. This presents great difficulty in imagining such a system being sustainable in the long run. Its gears must stop whenever an equilibrium is reached between the contestants (“competers”) and the non-contestants (“non-competers”).</p>

<p>To the concerned observer, Adam Smith’s “Cappitalism” makes it seem like there is no tomorrow for the average magnate. Every railway, road, or cornfield he turns his watchful eye to is already populated with other magnates. Furthermore, “Cappitalistic” companies use certain “pests” a polite society, in turn, calls “workers,” who have varying and hard-to-adapt skills, if any, and are exhaustingly classless. Fortunately, a Communistic business owner does not have to worry about such nuisances. Workers in Communism have skillsets that are exactly alike or very similar, reducing noise in recruiting and increasing efficiency in education and work. That is, however, just one side of the shared coin.</p>

<p>In the strictest sense, enabling Communism disables competition. Magnates like you, and myself for that matter, are then able to truly cooperate—instead of being at each other’s throats in a quest for resources.</p>

<h2 id="principles-of-dynamic-value">Principles of Dynamic Value</h2>

<p>I appear to have forfeited from defining who a magnate is, and must do so to prevent any misunderstanding going forward. A magnate is a direct operator of industry who uses advanced methods in systemic thinking to run enterprises, farms, laboratories, political organizations, social service entities, and the like. He is the truest form of creator ever to be found in society. Magnates are not at all common, and, because of their ability, in high demand.</p>

<p>The ability of magnates encompasses much more than the tight-knit skillset of everyone else inside a system, where <em>everyone else</em> is more suitable for activities of lesser cognitive load and means for cooperation. The vast portion of a society rifles through life in this limited way, leaving free room for the (sought-after) magnate to roam and aim for an unlimited upside. With this, competition no longer has to exist between magnates themselves or between magnates and <em>everyone else</em>, regardless of <em>everyone else</em>’s seemingly natural tendency to compete. Despite this tendency, when magnates and <em>everyone else</em> are properly separated, there are fewer risks of competition occurring, even among <em>everyone else</em>. Separated, because mixing in people with such different skillsets may yield significantly lower efficiency in production—levelled cooperation is simply not on the table.</p>

<p>Targets and aspirations between magnates and <em>everyone else</em> differ greatly, and little common ground can be found in between. The separation is one of the very steps that make Communism a truly astounding and elegant system. A system suitable not just for social structures but also for nonliving, mechanical things alike.</p>

<p>Let’s now point your attention to yourself. Although I do not know your circumstances, the rules never deviate. Besides, having a strictly defined “role” is both a constraint and the opposite of what makes one a strong operator in Communism.</p>

<h2 id="at-bottom">At Bottom</h2>

<p>Whatever the enterprise, your first item of action must be to become an orchestrator if you are not one already. One who does not have to operate machinery by hand, so to speak. This means that the top of your checklist should contain the acquisition of delegate-ability, or, in simpler terms, the ability to issue orders. To the beginner, this may seem like an impossible task, but I assure you that even the mildest trickery will do.</p>

<p>Start by asking a colleague or even your superior for help of the innocent kind. Observe the environment and never push too hard. Then, to some small extent, ask for help with your main operations. Increase that extent gradually. Once you have eased your engagement with your main operations, strategically navigate through other or similar departments and employ yourself in them until it is clear to your own department that you are, in fact, making great efforts. At some point, a cycle of this will complete, and you are to repeat this process inside your new department(s) until nothing is left unexplored.</p>

<p>A journey like this will surely remove all traces of a “role” you may have had and prepare you for the title of a real magnate. You may now ask, what happens when you have been through all the departments in an enterprise? It is quite simple. At this point, you are indispensable, and your presence—inescapable. At this point, it will be very difficult for the enterprise owners not to give away their ownership to you little by little, until a sizable portion forges you into a magnate. When you feel you’ve finally been allowed access to magnateism, the following should explain how to use it.</p>

<h2 id="when-in-rome">When in Rome</h2>

<p>Whilst the preceding section had to be included for universality purposes, this section is dedicated to the real target audience, that is, established magnates. In “Cappitalism”, people enjoy thinking their enterprises and industries are cutthroat and that’s supposedly what makes them good. Such thinking offers truth but disregards the alternative, where it is possible for owners to collaborate or even unify enterprises to make them bigger and effortless to control.</p>

<p>The bigger enterprises get, the more trust they’ll earn from their consumers. What’s missing then is only the collaboration with the government of your enterprises. If attained, such endeavours may yield opportunities to set custom pricing of produce and remove all needs for economic arguments moving forward.</p>

<p>Direct price-setting dismantles the complexities of the fiscal apparatus and makes the market freer, more understandable for everyone in your system. A market is free when pricing is clear and well-understood by all participants. However, to be able to conduct effective pricecontrol, a magnate like you may need to think about savings. To not spend on materials, labour, and end-produce as much as your set pricing brings, and to be even more flexible with your newly acquired pricecontrol. Achieving these savings maximally requires offloading labour requirements offshore, to cheaper lands where neither magnates nor <em>everyone else</em> is as progressed and would be happy to do more for less.</p>

<p>Active cooperation between magnates can introduce more benefits than just general pricecontrol. Exclusive opportunities often become available, as diverse backgrounds of your fellow magnates usually hide exposure to newer or more foreign markets. This exposure might very well be volatile, especially with regions in crisis where demand even for the bare necessities is high and where the non-set priceaction of produce is more sudden and significant. Purchasing certain critical materials ahead of known happenings, then reselling to those in the greatest need, is indeed immensely rewarding. Such opportunities, which are explained to you in advance by fellow magnates, can not only benefit you fiscally but also bring more excitement and joy into your life. However, you should not forget that in collaboration, you too have the loose duty of sharing interesting findings from your industry with your fellows, which in turn could attract even more opportunities and sharing by them in the future.</p>

<p>Returning from foreign markets to your free markets at home will certainly offer even more chances to pursue new domestic investments and to adopt materials. Knowledge and understanding of highly uncivilized lands will assist in making better calls to action in fatherland.</p>

<h2 id="everyone-else"><em>Everyone Else</em></h2>

<p>It is desirable that <em>everyone else</em> has equal opportunities and is rewarded equally well for their efforts, just like you do inside your circle of magnates. A small issue, however, prevents perfecting this vision to the fullest. It is difficult to enforce a zero-competition rule completely, but some ingenuity, depending on the enterprise, can go a long way.</p>

<p>To demonstrate the hurdle:</p>

<p>Alice, Bob, Vladimir, and Lena all work in the same department of Final Ship Engine Inspection and Testing, polishing and running the tests. Let’s say that Alice, wanting to impress everyone in her department and to get attention from the higher-ups, pushes through her work on the remaining engines faster than ever before. The rest of the FSEIT department continues as usual. Just because a few remaining engines had one of their steps done faster does not mean that Alice has improved the efficiency of the department, so it would make little sense for her income of the day to be higher. Being paid by the hour, Alice must remain in the factory until the day’s end, and labour still. Bob and Lena are not too happy having to see a colleague standing with nothing to labour on, and Vladimir, having gone to one of Alice’s finished engines, sees that the fuel is all wrong after a rushed operation. It is not that initiative and new effort is bad every time. It is that wanting to better oneself among defined equals is sometimes bound to cause trouble instead of assisting.</p>

<p>Now imagine that instead, two people—Bob and Vladimir—are competing to get a seat at the Orders department table, even without knowing for certain that it is possible. If one of them happens to invent a new, faster method of inspection or discover a better compound for cleaning, competition could be seen as a highly advantageous option. More often than not, this duel could end poorly due to them trying to sabotage each other or create other sorts of malicious schemes. Considering equality instead, Bob and Vladimir may begin attempts to better themselves together; their mutual competence may bring mutual rewards. Alice, if she happens to finish earlier than expected, could help her colleagues do that as well, and if they all finish earlier, they might all get access and labour in related departments for the remainder, actually increasing the factory’s efficiency and possibly benefiting together later. Those who have not seen the fruits of helping and sharing have historically fallen to their animalistic instincts and unadulterated jealousy. The following example discusses.</p>

<h2 id="yielding">Yielding</h2>

<p>The Siege of Bostonia (Bastonia) in San Serriffe that took place twelve fortyears ago still lingers as a warning to magnates big and small across fatherland. <em>Everyone else</em> had stopped being content with being <em>everyone else</em>, taking to the streets to capture and force-poison known magnates of the day. This backfired with unseen inertia when due to panic, daily irregularities, and chaos in the streets, <em>everyone else</em> started lynching <em>everyone else</em>, which is when the initially planned activities had to be stopped. So, they attempted to keep only “more tolerable” magnates from there.</p>

<p>You will be pleased to know that since these undesirable occurrences, your magnate ancestors have been taking protective measures against such ordeals by adding spike-like objects masked as decorations to buildings and public areas of ritual habitation, increasing the general spending on defenders, and spreading awareness on the importance of magnates via various media. And, as you may know, magnates of today are not as irresponsible as magnates of yesteryear. The streets are safe, and so are you.</p>

<hr />

<p>The curse of competition still floats deep inside of us. To conquer, to obtain, to survive, to create. But if we remember that only with absolute equality can we have freedom, it may help us forget competition and leave it to the animal kingdom, for we have moved so far beyond it. The last thing that must not be forgotten is that while Communism is in fact the most profitable system we have today, it is only the most profitable that has been discovered so far. One can only wonder what exciting new systems futurefolk may find out, the levels of profitability unseen before…</p>
