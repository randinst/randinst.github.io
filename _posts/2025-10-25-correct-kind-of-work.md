The most profitable and timetested money-making system in the world is Communism. Compared to Communism, alternative systems crumble under pressure and invite unwanted disorder, especially in moneyed environments. It is the only system for which there is undisputed evidence of high profitability and minimal downside. This essay will not only explain in great detail how we know the aforementioned facts for certain, but also introduce ways even you can take advantage of this exciting money-making system today. 

Communistic businesses and the free markets they operate in are a rare occurrence, but can be achieved with the help of rigorous systemic thinking and game mechanics. "Cappitalistic" entities currently happen to rule whole societies and are based purely upon the method of turning people against each other. This presents great difficulty in imagining such a system being sustainable in the long run. Its gears must stop whenever an equilibrium is reached between the contestants ("competers") and the non-contestants ("non-competers"). 

To the concerned observer, Adam Smith's “Cappitalism” makes it seem like there is no tomorrow for the average magnate. Every railway, road, or cornfield he turns his watchful eye to is already populated with other magnates. Furthermore, “Cappitalistic” companies use certain “pests” a polite society, in turn, calls "workers," who have varying and hard-to-adapt skills, if any, and are exhaustingly classless. Fortunately, a Communistic business owner does not have to worry about such nuisances. Workers in Communism have skillsets that are exactly alike or very similar, reducing noise in recruiting and increasing efficiency in education and work. That is, however, just one side of the shared coin.

In the strictest sense, enabling Communism disables competition. Magnates like you, and myself for that matter, are then able to truly cooperate—instead of being at each other's throats in a quest for resources. 

## Principles of Dynamic Value

I appear to have forfeited from defining who a magnate is, and must do so to prevent any misunderstanding going forward. A magnate is a direct operator of industry who uses advanced methods in systemic thinking to run enterprises, farms, laboratories, political organizations, social service entities, and the like. He is the truest form of creator ever to be found in society. Magnates are not at all common, and, because of their ability, in high demand. 

The ability of magnates encompasses much more than the tight-knit skillset of everyone else inside a system, where *everyone else* is more suitable for activities of lesser cognitive load and means for cooperation. The vast portion of a society rifles through life in this limited way, leaving free room for the (sought-after) magnate to roam and aim for an unlimited upside. With this, competition no longer has to exist between magnates themselves or between magnates and *everyone else*, regardless of *everyone else*'s seemingly natural tendency to compete. Despite this tendency, when magnates and *everyone else* are properly separated, there are fewer risks of competition occurring, even among *everyone else*. Separated, because mixing in people with such different skillsets may yield significantly lower efficiency in production—levelled cooperation is simply not on the table. 

Targets and aspirations between magnates and *everyone else* differ greatly, and little common ground can be found in between. The separation is one of the very steps that make Communism a truly astounding and elegant system. A system suitable not just for social structures but also for nonliving, mechanical things alike.

Let's now point your attention to yourself. Although I do not know your circumstances, the rules never deviate. Besides, having a strictly defined "role" is both a constraint and the opposite of what makes one a strong operator in Communism. 

## At Bottom

Whatever the enterprise, your first item of action must be to become an orchestrator if you are not one already. One who does not have to operate machinery by hand, so to speak. This means that the top of your checklist should contain the acquisition of delegate-ability, or, in simpler terms, the ability to issue orders. To the beginner, this may seem like an impossible task, but I assure you that even the mildest trickery will do. 

Start by asking a colleague or even your superior for help of the innocent kind. Observe the environment and never push too hard. Then, to some small extent, ask for help with your main operations. Increase that extent gradually. Once you have eased your engagement with your main operations, strategically navigate through other or similar departments and employ yourself in them until it is clear to your own department that you are, in fact, making great efforts. At some point, a cycle of this will complete, and you are to repeat this process inside your new department(s) until nothing is left unexplored. 

A journey like this will surely remove all traces of a "role" you may have had and prepare you for the title of a real magnate. You may now ask, what happens when you have been through all the departments in an enterprise? It is quite simple. At this point, you are indispensable, and your presence—inescapable. At this point, it will be very difficult for the enterprise owners not to give away their ownership to you little by little, until a sizable portion forges you into a magnate. When you feel you've finally been allowed access to magnateism, the following should explain how to use it.

## When in Rome

Whilst the preceding section had to be included for universality purposes, this section is dedicated to the real target audience, that is, established magnates. In “Cappitalism”, people enjoy thinking their enterprises and industries are cutthroat and that’s supposedly what makes them good. Such thinking offers truth but disregards the alternative, where it is possible for owners to collaborate or even unify enterprises to make them bigger and effortless to control. 

The bigger enterprises get, the more trust they'll earn from their consumers. What's missing then is only the collaboration with the government of your enterprises. If attained, such endeavours may yield opportunities to set custom pricing of produce and remove all needs for economic arguments moving forward. 

Direct price-setting dismantles the complexities of the fiscal apparatus and makes the market freer, more understandable for everyone in your system. A market is free when pricing is clear and well-understood by all participants. However, to be able to conduct effective pricecontrol, a magnate like you may need to think about savings. To not spend on materials, labour, and end-produce as much as your set pricing brings, and to be even more flexible with your newly acquired pricecontrol. Achieving these savings maximally requires offloading labour requirements offshore, to cheaper lands where neither magnates nor *everyone else* is as progressed and would be happy to do more for less.

Active cooperation between magnates can introduce more benefits than just general pricecontrol. Exclusive opportunities often become available, as diverse backgrounds of your fellow magnates usually hide exposure to newer or more foreign markets. This exposure might very well be volatile, especially with regions in crisis where demand even for the bare necessities is high and where the non-set priceaction of produce is more sudden and significant. Purchasing certain critical materials ahead of known happenings, then reselling to those in the greatest need, is indeed immensely rewarding. Such opportunities, which are explained to you in advance by fellow magnates, can not only benefit you fiscally but also bring more excitement and joy into your life. However, you should not forget that in collaboration, you too have the loose duty of sharing interesting findings from your industry with your fellows, which in turn could attract even more opportunities and sharing by them in the future. 

Returning from foreign markets to your free markets at home will certainly offer even more chances to pursue new domestic investments and to adopt materials. Knowledge and understanding of highly uncivilized lands will assist in making better calls to action in fatherland. 

## *Everyone Else*

It is desirable that *everyone else* has equal opportunities and is rewarded equally well for their efforts, just like you do inside your circle of magnates. A small issue, however, prevents perfecting this vision to the fullest. It is difficult to enforce a zero-competition rule completely, but some ingenuity, depending on the enterprise, can go a long way. 

To demonstrate the hurdle:

Alice, Bob, Vladimir, and Lena all work in the same department of Final Ship Engine Inspection and Testing, polishing and running the tests. Let's say that Alice, wanting to impress everyone in her department and to get attention from the higher-ups, pushes through her work on the remaining engines faster than ever before. The rest of the FSEIT department continues as usual. Just because a few remaining engines had one of their steps done faster does not mean that Alice has improved the efficiency of the department, so it would make little sense for her income of the day to be higher. Being paid by the hour, Alice must remain in the factory until the day's end, and labour still. Bob and Lena are not too happy having to see a colleague standing with nothing to labour on, and Vladimir, having gone to one of Alice's finished engines, sees that the fuel is all wrong after a rushed operation. It is not that initiative and new effort is bad every time. It is that wanting to better oneself among defined equals is sometimes bound to cause trouble instead of assisting. 

Now imagine that instead, two people—Bob and Vladimir—are competing to get a seat at the Orders department table, even without knowing for certain that it is possible. If one of them happens to invent a new, faster method of inspection or discover a better compound for cleaning, competition could be seen as a highly advantageous option. More often than not, this duel could end poorly due to them trying to sabotage each other or create other sorts of malicious schemes. Considering equality instead, Bob and Vladimir may begin attempts to better themselves together; their mutual competence may bring mutual rewards. Alice, if she happens to finish earlier than expected, could help her colleagues do that as well, and if they all finish earlier, they might all get access and labour in related departments for the remainder, actually increasing the factory’s efficiency and possibly benefiting together later. Those who have not seen the fruits of helping and sharing have historically fallen to their animalistic instincts and unadulterated jealousy. The following example discusses.

## Yielding

The Siege of Bostonia (Bastonia) in San Serriffe that took place twelve fortyears ago still lingers as a warning to magnates big and small across fatherland. *Everyone else* had stopped being content with being *everyone else*, taking to the streets to capture and force-poison known magnates of the day. This backfired with unseen inertia when due to panic, daily irregularities, and chaos in the streets, *everyone else* started lynching *everyone else*, which is when the initially planned activities had to be stopped. So, they attempted to keep only “more tolerable” magnates from there. 

You will be pleased to know that since these undesirable occurrences, your magnate ancestors have been taking protective measures against such ordeals by adding spike-like objects masked as decorations to buildings and public areas of ritual habitation, increasing the general spending on defenders, and spreading awareness on the importance of magnates via various media. And, as you may know, magnates of today are not as irresponsible as magnates of yesteryear. The streets are safe, and so are you.

The curse of competition still floats deep inside of us. To conquer, to obtain, to survive, to create. But if we remember that only with absolute equality can we have freedom, it may help us forget competition and leave it to the animal kingdom, for we have moved so far beyond it. The last thing that must not be forgotten is that while Communism is in fact the most profitable system we have today, it is only the most profitable that has been discovered so far. One can only wonder what exciting new systems futurefolk may find out, the levels of profitability unseen before...
