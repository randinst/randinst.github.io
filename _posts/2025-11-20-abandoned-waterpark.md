A bald man heftly built throws you in the water off the ramp, along with a man-sized iron arrow you must catch in fall. 

The man don't ask but throw, as you balance into the routine from ignorance total. 

By the third throw, resistance mild and mind begin to go.

As you wake safe from the third throw and see—the arrow is no-mo, run to thrower, ask, "Forgive for losing arrow without bow!"

Consciousness lost again, 'till says the man glowing in white room, "Time to finish this at once," rope that's clean and pearl and fit, round your leg, round his neck, on the cleanest bed, forks and knives around—eyes show! 

Mode pure-panic then absorbs, as the mind for exit quickly warps, images of knees and toes falling to his twisted cutlery woes.

Rope untangled, use all force, get off room—of course! Bash a window, step on board, leave the travesty alone! 

Flow of thought diminishes again, all that’s left is just delay.
